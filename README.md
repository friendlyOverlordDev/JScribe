# JScribe
is a simple tool to add texts to graphics.

Developed in Java to allow usage on many different platforms.

Since pictures are usually better than a long text here a few pictures of the program:
![main window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friendlyOverlordDev/JScribe/master/screenshot/mainWindow.png)
The main editor for placing as well as editing text and notes.
Notes can be converted to text and neither notes nor borders around text will be displayed when images are exported.

With the style editor and a tag-based styling system the style of multiple components can be changed easily.
