How to run it:
- Usually it is enough to double click the .jar file.
- If nothing happens or a dialog opens, asking for a program to open the file with, you most likely need to install Java.
- This program needs Java 8 or higher. You can find Java here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
- The JRE-release of Java is usually enough. JDK would also work, but is intended for developers.
